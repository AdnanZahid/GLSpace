GLSpace
=======

Taking 3D websites to multiple screens.


This is project requires NodeJS to run. Download it from here http://nodejs.org/download

After that go to Command Prompt, navigate to the project directory and run

							"node server.js"

Then point your brower to http://localhost:8080/launcher.html

Disable your browser's Pop-up blocker and then click the start button.


This will make 3 pop-up windows on your screen. They can be opened on different screens or even different machines if they are interconnected.


Now use "directional keys" to navigate. Note that this project currently features X and Y-axis movement only (no rotation or Z-axis movement).


There are 3 address bars in the middle window to allow users to change websites. At the moment it only allows HTTP.


Navigate your way around GLSpace and enjoy!
