Step-by-step instructions for non-windows-users
===============================================

This project requires NodeJS to run. Download it from here http://nodejs.org/download

1) Assuming you have NodeJS installed and running (and you have configured environment variables), go to Terminal, navigate to the project directory and run

							"node server.js"

2) Run Chrome (not Chromium or any other browser) from Command Line using these flags "--enable-usermedia-screen-capturing --allow-http-screen-capture"

3) Disable pop-up blockers in Chrome.

4) Open three windows of Chrome with any websites you want.

5) Open another window and point it to "http://localhost:8080/launcher.html" or simply "http://localhost/launcher.html" (if your Port 80 is not blocked).

6) Use "Share 1st screen", "Share 2nd screen" and "Share 3rd screen" buttons to share the Chrome windows.

7) Next, hit "Synchronize screens". If all goes correctly, it should synchronize GLSpace across all three of your screens.

8) Navigate using "WASD" or "Directional Keys".
